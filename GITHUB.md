# GitHub and current source state

Updated 12 September 2026. This file documents source storage, not production readiness.

| Component | GitHub repository | Visibility | Current development/release branch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ios | [danielmccann1705-art/Snaglist-iOS](https://github.com/danielmccann1705-art/Snaglist-iOS) | private | `feature/unified-platform` |
| backend | [danielmccann1705-art/SnagLinkBackend](https://github.com/danielmccann1705-art/SnagLinkBackend) | public | `feature/unified-platform` |
| portal | [danielmccann1705-art/Snaglist-Portal](https://github.com/danielmccann1705-art/Snaglist-Portal) | private | `feature/unified-portal` |

## This checkout

- Repository: https://github.com/danielmccann1705-art/snaglist-website-next
- Push remote: `origin`.
- Current work: `release/website-usesnaglist`. The branch contains the implementation history and the instruction/readiness documentation; a local commit is backed up only after its GitHub branch SHA matches.
- This GitHub update does not merge into `main`, submit an App Store release or activate online services. Existing repository visibility is preserved; the new portal repository is private.
- Push the intended branch explicitly after reviewing its diff and secret scan. Do not use blanket `git add -A`, `git push --all`, `--mirror` or force-push as a backup shortcut.

## Current release boundary

Dan confirmed on 12 September 2026 that the currently released iOS app has **no online services**. The online services and manager portal are planned together for **v2.0**. A backend deployment, synthetic test or network-capable branch does not establish released functionality. Preserve existing offline use and on-device data.

The unified app/portal is not release-ready until ownership-backed import, account isolation, the complete canonical sync journey, permissions/private media, provider/billing checks and D1/D2 acceptance are complete. Prove ordinary iOS capture → distinct authorised portal manager → scoped Contractor link → completion evidence → accepted closure → app/fresh-device/report parity. Local test success does not replace this acceptance.

The website release branch contains the current website implementation and the correction distinguishing the released offline app from planned v2.0 online services.

## What belongs in GitHub

Commit application source, source assets, relevant tests, safe example configuration and maintained project documentation. Keep credentials, customer records, bearer links/PINs, local databases, build caches and machine-specific agent settings out of source control. The developer's personal skill overrides live outside these repositories; `AGENTS.md` records the portable project agreement.

GitHub stores source. Cloudflare is the deployment platform; a push is not proof of deployment. The backend still contains historical workflows for `main` and `staging`; these current feature-branch pushes do not run those deployment workflows. Reconcile retired Hetzner automation before any future main/staging release change.

The Snaglist Google Drive knowledge bank remains the location for the controlling brief/register and approved brand/design assets. For current project instructions, start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), then the references relevant to the task.
